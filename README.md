### Tamil Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition React App
This is a react app that uses a BERT based Language Model to identifythe presence of named entities and returns the sentiment of the input sentence provided by the user.

### Introduction 
Tamil as a language has complex grammar rules and different structures for various sentences. It is difficult for automatic machine translators to follow these complicated rules and structures for translation. Due to the lack of open source data for the Tamil language, it is difficult to efficiently train the model to allow the machines to understand the language better. The goal of this project is to gather Tamil language data from different sources, annotate the extracted data with NER tags, and sentiment values, and perform the proposed NLP tasks

### Motivation
Current language translators find it challenging to adhere to the unique sentence structures and complex grammatical rules when it comes to the Tamil. One word in the English takes multiple forms and words when translated into the Tamil

### Scope
*Collection and scraping of data* - Tamil language data is gathered from various sources on the web including pages like blogs, review articles and news articles which have clearly worded sentences and follow proper grammar structure that can be valuable in giving a clear idea of how the language is structured. 

*Annotation and Analysis of data* - The data is collected and the various metadata about it is added to the data to create a dataset which has additional data that can be used by the model through which various analyses can be performed to further increase the size of the data set.

*Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition* - The annotated dataset will be used to perform various NLP tasks such as Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition.
